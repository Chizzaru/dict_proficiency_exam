### What is the ICT Specialist Proficiency Examination?

The ICT Specialist Proficiency Examination is designed to evaluate the competence of an individual to perform
programming or systems analysis and design functions. This is pursuant to PD 1408, which directs the National
Computer Center (NCC) and the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to devise ways of determining the fitness of individuals
in occupying highly technical ICT positions and through which the awarding of appropriate ICT (EDP) Specialist Eligibility
will be based. NCC and CSC therefore conduct tests in the area of Computer Programming.

### What Civil Service Eligibility will be granted to successful examinees?

The EDP Specialist Eligibility (EDPSE) shall be conferred to passers of the proficiency test, or passers of the training
courses conducted by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), through the National ICT
Competency Management Service (NCM), on courses on Systems Analysis and Design and Computer Programming
(granted pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 90-083 dated January 22, 1990).

### What positions can the earned eligibility be applied to? 

The EDPSE shall be considered appropriate only to functionally related positions belonging to the Information
Technology/Management Information System Group, such as Data Encoder, Data Machine Operator, Auxiliary Machine
Operator, Data Encoder-Controller, Computer Programmer, Information Systems Analyst, and to other positions as may
be determined by the CSC. (Provided under Item No. 8, Part V of CSC MC No. 12, s. 2003 re: Revised Policies on
